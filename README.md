# Accident Severity Prediction

This project aims to predict the severity of road accidents using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset, available at [kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents](kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), contains information about various attributes related to road accidents in the United States.

## Project Overview

Accurate prediction of accident severity can help in understanding the factors that contribute to accidents and enable authorities to take proactive measures to prevent them. By analyzing the available dataset, we can build a predictive model that takes into account various features such as weather conditions, road type, time of day, and other relevant factors to estimate the severity of accidents.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a comprehensive collection of accident records, including information about the location, time, weather conditions, and other relevant attributes. It provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating our predictive model.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from [kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents](kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).
2. Preprocess the dataset to clean and transform the data as needed.
3. Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Use the trained model to predict the severity of accidents based on new input data.
